Last.fm widget for your website

Built on javascript
Shows Last played tracks from last.fm for a user
Also shows now playing track. :)

Integration:
1. Add 
	<script type="text/javascript" src="last_widget.js"></script> 
	to <head> section of HTML.
	Or just before </body> if you want the script to function after the complete page load, so that other don't get slowed down.

2. Insert :
	<table id="last_tracks"></table>
	where you want the script to write the track lists.
	See index.html for example

3. Edit first line of last_widget.js:
	var username = 'xtranophilist';
	Replace xtranophilist with your last.fm username

You are done.

To Dos:

1. Use <div> instead of <table>
	Any contribution would be appreciated.

2. Better styling

3. Find a way to get the feed direct from Last.fm (w/o using Yahoo Pipe as Proxy for JSON)
